 
1. The function of the code: 

To measure the cosmic shear signal using CCD images of CFHTlens processed by THELI. 

********************************************************************************************

2. To compile and run:

> f77 *.f -o main -lcfitsio
> ./main

*********************************************************************************************
3. The structure of the code:

The main program is in 'main.f', which calls the following subroutines:

1) "assign_field_info"(main.f): loading field names & their corresponding exposure names to data groups;
2) "field_processing"(main.f): this is the main subroutine for image processing & shear measurement, one needs to specify the position of the field in W1;
3) "shear_FD_test_multiple_field"(shear_field_test.f): comparing the Fourier_Quad shear & the shear due to field distortion;
4) "shear_FD_test_multiple_field_CFHTlens"(shear_field_test.f): comparing the lensfit shear & the shear due to field distortion;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our main subroutine "field_processing"(main.f), there are the following subroutines:

1) "read_info"(read_info.f): reading the CCD images, the weight images, the astrometry parameters from the header files, galaxy and star catalogs, and then confirming the source identities, generating the galaxy/star stamps & catalogs;  

>>>>(I) "readimage"(rw_fits_image.f): reading the .fits images;

>>>>(II) "read_head"(read_info.f): reading the astrometry parameters from .head files;

>>>>(III) "mark_image"(read_info.f): creating a mark image of the CCD image so that properties of each pixel can be identified (also using the information of the weight image);

>>>>(IV) "gen_star_catalog"(gen_catalog.f): generating the star catalogs & stamps;	 

>>>>(V) "gen_gal_catalog"(gen_catalog.f): generating the galaxy catalogs & stamps;

>>>> There are several subroutines commonly called in "gen_star_catalog" & "gen_gal_catalog":

>>>>(VI) "coordinate_transfer"(read_info.f): transforming the coordinates from CCD position (in pixel) RA & DEC or the other way;

>>>>(VII) "field_distortion"(read_info.f): calculating the shear due to field distortion at the position of the galaxy;

>>>>(VIII) "check_source" (gen_catalog.f): checking the validity of the source image (galaxy & star);

>>>>(IX) "find_noise" (gen_catalog.f): find the background noise image near the galaxy image;

>>>>(X) "write_stamps"(rw_fits_image.f): writing the galaxy/star stamps to a big stamp.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) "measure_shear"(measure_shear.f): reading the galaxy/star catalogs & loading the corresponding stamps, and then preparing for PSF interpolation, measuring galaxy shear;

>>>>(I) "prepare_PSF"(measure_shear.f): preparing for the PSF interpolation, which includes the following subroutines:

>>>>>>>>(a) "read_star_catalog"(read_catalog.f): reading the star catalog & stamps;
>>>>>>>>(b) "get_power"(FFTPACK.f): calculating the Fourier power spectrum of an image;
>>>>>>>>(c) "smooth_image55ln"(universal.f): smoothing the power spectrum of an image;
>>>>>>>>(d) "regularize_power"(universal.f): subtracting the shot-noise contribution to the power spectrum, and then normalize the power so that the power at k=0 is 1;
>>>>>>>>(e) "prepare_star_kriging","kriging_setup","poly_PSF_setup","mean_PSF_setup"(interpolate_PSF.f): preparing for the interpolation of PSF with different methods;
 
>>>>(II) "process_galaxy"(measure_shear.f): Measuring galaxy shear using Fourier_Quad method;

>>>>>>>>(a) "read_gal_catalog"(read_catalog.f): reading the galaxy catalog & stamps;
>>>>>>>>(b) "trim_power"(universal.f): subtracting the shot-noise contribution to the power spectrum;
>>>>>>>>(c) "get_PSF"(measure_shear.f): getting the PSF at the position of the galaxy;
>>>>>>>>(d) "get_shear"(measure_shear.f): measuring shear using Fourier_Quad method;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) "merge_exposures"(merger_shear_catalog.f): grouping shear catalogs of all exposures in the same field into one big array, and the information of the same galaxy in different exposures are grouped together;

4) "merger_shear_catalog"(merger_shear_catalog.f): merging the shear catalogs of all exposures of one field into one catalog of that field, keeping the identities of the same galaxy on different exposures;

5) "shrink_catalog"(merger_shear_catalog.f): reading the shear catalogs of one field, and collapsing the identities of the same galaxy on different exposures into a single identity;

6) "w_SNR_relation"(w_SNR_relation.f): plot the relation between the galaxy weight function and the signal-to-noise-ratio of the galaxy.
